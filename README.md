### About me

I am 16 years old and I love programming very much. I'm trying to create useful libraries. I can talk for 3 hours non-stop why Rust is better than C++ (depression due to segfault). **English is not my native language.** My dream is freedom software and creation of my own cryptocurrency. I like to play HOI4, Genshin Impact, ULTRAKILL, Touhou Project and Minecraft.
